# Classroom Randomizer

Classroom randomizer built with Python and the PyQT framework.

## Goals of this Project

The main goal of this project is to implement a GUI which provides several 
randomization functions for use in a classroom.  A class list will provide
the necessary parameters for randomization.  This project will be divided into
three main parts.

### Importation of Class List

1. Import class list
2. Edit class list within the GUI
3. Save the class list

Error checking will occur when a class list is imported to correlate with a 
template selected within the settings.  

### Picking Groups and Students at Random

This section of the program will pick a pre-determined number of students at
random with the option to duplicate picks.  This section will also provide 
functionality to assign groups based on selected sizes, with the option of
equally mixing genders.  

### Seating Chart Assignment

The final area of this program will visualize a seating chart based on a 
selected grid with options to mix genders.
